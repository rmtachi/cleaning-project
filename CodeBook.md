# UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset

## Dataset Information

The original dataset is stored on the UCI machine learning repository ([here]), and the source is from Universit&#224 degli Studi di Genova. The data records the 3-dimensional acceleration and 3-dimensional angular acceleration for 30 subjects performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). Each activity was sampled at 50Hz, with duration ranging between approximately 5 to 10 seconds. The data was then processed in a number of steps, summarized below:

1. Pre-processed for noise and captured in 2.56s (128 readings at 50 Hz) sliding windows.
2. Run through a series of filters and transforms to produce 33 primary variables.
3. A number of statistics were computed on each variable, creating a total of 516 variables for each window (refered to as the feature vector). 

A full description of the data can be found on the site linked to above and corresponding README.txt file.

## Data merging and summary

The relevant data was received in a number of files:
* feature vectors for training set (data corresponding to 21 randomly selected subjects)
* feature vectors for test set (remaining 9 subjects)
* vector identifying subject for each training set feature vector
* vector identifying subject for each test set feature vector
* vector identifying activity for each training set feature vector
* vector identifying activity for each test set feature vector
* names of feature vector variables
* names of activities

For this project 2 of the 516 variables were of interest - the mean and standard deviation for each window. These variables were extracted and the test and training set variables were concatenated. Columns for subject, activity and set (training or test) were added.

Finally a reduced dataset was created, averaging variables across windows corresponding to each unique subject-activity combination, resulting in a dataset with 180 rows (30 subjects times 6 activities).

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
