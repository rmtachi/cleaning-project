# Repository content summary

This repository contains all data and scripts necessary to read and clean the UCI Human Activity Response dataset. More details of the scripts will follow.

The primary script is R\_analysis.R. This script includes code for dowloading and unzipping the compressed data. It can be run without modifications, except for the first line that sets the working data in which the data folder and scripts will be stored.
